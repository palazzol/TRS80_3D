Generating 3D movies - stereo or not:

Python code:
    Defines movie (done)
    Generates data file for each frame, consisting of 2D line drawing statements:
        move to pixel
        drawline to pixel

Assembly Code:
    Two phases - generating, and rendering
    Generating -
        draw each frame from line drawing primitives, save to RAMBO
    Rendering -
        load each from from rambo for viewing

For now:
    one exe combines program and data

Stretch goals
    put data for movie in its own file
    Main proram loads and renders each, perhaps with file picker
